<para>

ARM systems are a lot more heterogenous than the i386/amd64-based PC
architecture, where all systems share a common system firmware (BIOS or/and
UEFI) which handles the board-specific basic hardware initialization in a
standardized way.

The ARM architecture is used mainly in so-called <quote>systems-on-chip</quote> (SOCs). 
These SOCs are designed by many different companies with vastly varying
hardware components even for the very basic functionality required to bring
the system up.  Systems using them usually lack a common system firmware
interface and as a result, on ARM systems the Linux kernel has to take care
of many system-specific low-level issues which are handled by the
mainboard's BIOS in the PC world.

</para>

<para>

At the beginning of the ARM support in the Linux kernel, this resulted in
the requirement of having a seperate kernel for each ARM system in contrast
to the <quote>one-fits-all</quote> kernel for PC systems.  As this approach does not
scale to a large number of different systems, work has started to be able to
provide a single ARM kernel that can run on different ARM systems.  Support
for newer ARM systems gets implemented in a way that allows the use of such
a multiplatform kernel, but for several older systems a seperate specific
kernel is still required.

Because of this, the standard &debian; distribution only supports
installation on a selected number of older ARM systems in addition to the
newer systems which are supported by the ARM multiplatform (armmp) kernel. 

</para>

<para>

The ARM architecture has evolved over time and modern ARM processors provide
features which are not available in older models.  &debian; therefore
provides two ARM ports, the &debian;/armel and the &debian;/armhf port. 
&debian;/armel targets older ARM processors without support for a hardware
floating point unit (FPU), while &debian;/armhf works only on newer ARM
processors which implement at least the ARMv7 architecture with version 3 of
the ARM vector floating point specification (VFPv3).  &debian;/armhf makes
use of the extended features and performance enhancements available on
these models.

</para>

<!--
<para>

While it is technically possible to run the &debian;/armel userland programs
on modern ARM processors, they cannot make use of several
performance-enhancing features of the newer processors, so if your hardware
fulfills the requirements of running the &debian;/armhf port, you should use
it instead of the &debian;/armel port.  Mixing of armel and armhf packages
on the same system is not possible, so you have to decide which port to use
before installing the system.

</para>
-->

<para>
Technically, several ARM CPUs can be run in either endian mode (big or little),
but in practice the vast majority of currently available systems
uses little-endian mode. Both &debian;/armhf and &debian;/armel support
only little-endian systems.

    Generally, the ARM multiplatform support in the Linux kernel allows
    running &d-i; on armhf systems not explicitly listed above, as long as
    the kernel used by &d-i; has support for the target system's components
    and a device-tree file for the target is available.  In these cases, the
    installer can usually provide a working userland installation, but it
    probably cannot automatically make the system bootable, as doing that in
    many cases requires device-specific information.
   
  </para>
  <para>
    When using &d-i; on such systems, you have to manually make the system 
    bootable at the end of the installation, e.g. by running the required
    commands in a shell started from within &d-i;.
