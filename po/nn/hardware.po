"At the beginning of the ARM support in the Linux kernel, this resulted in "

"systems. Support for newer ARM systems gets implemented in a way that allows "
"the use of such a multiplatform kernel, but for several older systems a "
"seperate specific kernel is still required. Because of this, the standard "
